This is a repo of trading strategy I developed using Trump tweets to identify the returns of the DowJones.


The digital world has shifted how information is  consumed. Social media have emerged as platforms which shape and influence the minds of the masses.  No where was this more visible than with the election of Donald Trump in 2016. Shortly after, he announced that he would communicate with base through Twitter. These tweets have included matters of national security, foreign affairs, and economic matters.  These notes from a sitting president were communicated to his 66.8 million followers in an instant. 

Our hypothesis is that Trump portrays an overall positive impact on the economy, however we cannot directly correlate his tweets to the market’s performance. Put differently, we are making the assumption that Trump’s tweets should not have an effect on specific stock prices.
